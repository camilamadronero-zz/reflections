When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When the project I'm working on is going to be done by more than one person or if my own project can be accessible from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I need to be able to control when to publish my changes to the repository. GitHub proyect may be a only stable version saver.
    And I may need to use GitHub project files anytime from anywhere, so a limited date and time can be an accesibility problem.
